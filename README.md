# TaskMaster

TaskMaster is a task manager app for Android.

## Changelog

### Lab 26

- Added a homepage that has a placeholder image and two buttons, one that links to the add a task activity and another that links to the all tasks activity.
- Added a task view that takes user input for a task name and description. 
  - Submitting the task displays an animated "submitted" message as well as increments the task count. 
  - These features are superficial at the moment and will reset each time the view is loaded.
- Added an all tasks view that will someday be home to a list of current tasks. Currently there is just a placeholder image and the title.

### Lab 27

- Re-worked the homepage to include a list of 3 static tasks.
- Added a task details activity.
  - Each task on the homepage links to a details activity view that grabs the name of the task from the button clicked on the main activity.
  - Each task's details page also includes the same bit of lorem ipsum for now.
- Added a settings activity.
  - The user can input a username and save this username via SharedPreferences.
  - The saved username is displayed on the main activity in the format "{username}'s tasks" and loads every time the main activity is resumed.
  - The value in the textedit field also reflects the updated change when the user returns.
  - If the user hasn't saved a username yet or changes the value to an empty string, the main activity displays "My Tasks".


Implements basic activities for adding a task, viewing all tasks, and the main app screen.
